### Description

- This course teaches the theoretical and practical foundations for human computer interaction. It covers a wide overview of topics, techniques and approaches used for the design and evaluation of modern user interfaces.

- The course covers the principles that underlie successful user interfaces, provides an overview of input and output devices and user interface types, and familiarizes students with the methods for designing and evaluating user interfaces. Students learn to critically assess user interfaces, to design user interfaces themselves, and to evaluate them in empirical studies.

### Topics:

- Fundamentals of human-computer interaction
- User interface paradigms, input and output devices
- Desktop & graphical user interfaces
- Mobile user interfaces
- Natural user interfaces
- User-centered interaction design
- Design principles and guidelines
- Prototyping
