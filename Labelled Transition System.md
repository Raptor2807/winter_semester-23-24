- For short we use *LTS* 
- We start by presenting the definition of an LTS from process algebra. In Process algebra an LTS is a triple of system states or processes, a list of actions or labels and a transition relation.
- A Labelled transition system is a triple(Σ,  𝔸, →)
	-  Σ :- Is the set of processes or states
	- 𝔸 :- Is the set of atomic actions (ϵ ∈ 𝔸)
		- Actions can be parameterized a(d)
	- →:- is ⊆ Σ × 𝔸 × Σ ; is a transition relation.
