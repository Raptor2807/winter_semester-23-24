Recent advances in Machine Learning have led to strong performance in a wide range of tasks which led to a wide spread deployment roll out of such systems. ChatGPT and CoPilots for code and office applications just being a few prominent examples. In terms of privacy and security, this is a double-edged sword. ML techniques can be used to efficiently detect and prevent attacks (e.g., intrusion detection). However, their deployment to many real-world sensitive systems (e.g., self-driving cars, the cloud) also makes them susceptible to numerous attacks. As AI and ML becomes part of our IT infrastructure, we have to know and defend against cyber security threats.

The course explores in-depth both of these sides to Machine Learning and Cyber Security. 

### The content addresses the following areas:

- ML recap
- ML for improving security
- Attacks on ML
- Defenses for ML
- ML and Privacy
- Security of Large Language Models
